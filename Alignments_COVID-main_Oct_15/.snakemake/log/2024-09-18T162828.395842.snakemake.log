MissingOutputException in rule covid_alignment in file /Users/xdisga/Documents/Python_for_biologists/Alignments_COVID-main/Snakefile, line 50:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/xdisga/Documents/Python_for_biologists/Alignments_COVID-main/Merged_fasta_files/alignments_output.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: combined.fasta)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
